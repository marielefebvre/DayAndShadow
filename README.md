DayAndShadow
======
![Alt text](./Images/NightMove.png "")
This is 2D puzzle game where you have to reach the end tile with the less movements possible. But you can only move at night and need to hide in the shadow areas during the day time.

I made it with Unity 5 as a personal project.

I am currently working on improving the HUD.
